        <p>Hello! I'm Deepesh Patel, the creator of this Football Quiz. Ever since I can remember, football has been
            more than just a game to me—it's been a passion that runs deep in my veins. There's something truly magical
            about the beautiful game, from the thrill of a last-minute goal to the camaraderie shared with fellow fans.
            Football isn't just a sport; it's a way of life that brings people together, transcending language and
            culture.</p>

        <p>My love for the game found its true home in the heart of Italy, with the black and blue of Inter Milan. From
            the rich history of the club to the unforgettable moments of victory, Inter Milan has captured my heart like
            no other. The club's resilience, determination, and never-give-up attitude resonate with me deeply, and
            being a part of the Nerazzurri family is a source of immense pride.</p>

        <p>Whether it's watching a live match, analyzing the tactics, or playing a game with friends, football is where
            I find joy, inspiration, and a sense of belonging. Forza Inter! And all the best for the quiz!</p>
