        <p>Hello! I'm Deepesh Patel, the creator of this Football Quiz. My love for football started at a very young age, and it has been an integral part of my life ever since. Growing up, I spent countless hours watching matches, playing the game, and delving into the history and tactics of football. This passion for the beautiful game inspired me to create this quiz as a fun way for fellow football enthusiasts to test their knowledge and learn more about the sport. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just getting into football, I hope this quiz brings you as much joy as football has brought me throughout my life. Enjoy the quiz, and may the best football brain win!</p>
